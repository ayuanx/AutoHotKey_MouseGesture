Introduction:
This AutoHotKey based script implements the same functions of StrokeIt (actually even more powerful than it). You can define and draw all kinds of mouse gestures to do almost everything you can think of. Another great feature of this script is that it provides a powerful graphic user interface, so you can do all the configurations very easily.

How to use this script:
1. Downlaod AutoHotKey / AutoHotKey_L / AutoHotKey_L_x64, and install it.
2. Download this script, and put all files into AutoHotKey installation folder.
3. Run AutoHotKey, define and customize your own mouse gestures.
4. Just Stroke!

PS: Many predefined hotkeys and gestures by me are included in this script, feel free to tweak them!
    User defined hotkeys are in "MG_User.ahk" file.
